# MNISTDigitClassfication
Classifies images of handwritten digits using a model trained with MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates how to build a binary image classifier from scratch using logistic regression, without relying on deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts behind classification tasks in machine learning.

## Features
- Custom Predictor Function: Uses logistic regression for binary classification.
- Data Preprocessing: Includes steps like data scaling and train-test split.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using accuracy.

## Libraries Used
- ```numpy``` for numerical operations
- ```pandas``` for handling datasets
- ```matplotlib``` for data visualization
- ```scikit-learn``` for preprocessing and metrics
